## Ignore Java bytecode
*.class

## Ignore binaries and various files generated by Gradle tasks
*.bin
*.lock
*.probe
*.uniqueId1

## Ignore files in various web formats (to avoid tracking some
## files generated by Gradle tasks). Since no files of this type
## are used elsewhere, I simply ignore these extensions altogether
*.xml
*.html
